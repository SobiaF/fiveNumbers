Five Numbers

The player has three chances to choose the correct number from five possible numbers.

The only clue message provided depending on the number chosen can be 'larger' or 'smaller'.

The player will fail if they do not succeed to choose the right number in three chances.

(E.g: if a player chooses 5, and the number they need to choose is 7, then there will be a message showing 'larger'.)
